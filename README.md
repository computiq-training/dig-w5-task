# Week 5 Task
## Understanding
Add new feature that enable user to click on the one of patients rows from the patients table to redirect user to page `history` via define new route `history/id`.
This new page display the following sections:
- Section 1(Patient info): (FULL NAME capitalized as in XD, phone, age, and gender)
- Section 2(New Button): A button enable the user to open a Modal or dialog for adding new history record for this patient.
- Section 3(Patient Table): list history records of this patient which are loaded at loading the page.
- Section 4(Add New History Modal): be default this will be hidden, and once the user click on new button, this modal shown.



Let's take a scenario:
- User now at patients page and clicked on a patient row.
- User redirect to page `history/id`, id here is patient id to pass to the history page.
- Fetch patient profile information and history by doing a get request to get user by passed ID (/patients/id - GET)
- Fill profile information and history table.
- Once the user click on `new` button, a Modal/Dialog displayed for the user to fill new history data to submit.
- when the user click on `save` button in Dialog/Modal, a validation on the inputs should be implemented, then submit the data to the endpoint `patients/id/history  - POST`
- The modal must close once the record added and the fields of the modal should be cleared.
- New Record must be added directly in real-time to the table.
- Use can delete a history by click on delete button of the history row.
